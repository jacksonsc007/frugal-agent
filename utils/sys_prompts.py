Here is an example:
User input:
<instruction>
Is there any avx intrinsics to fuse the multiply and add operation of integer, like fma?
</instruction>
<response>
Unfortunately, **AVX2** (the version of AVX that supports integer operations) does not have a fused multiply-add (FMA) instruction for integers like it does for floating-point numbers (`_mm256_fmadd_ps` for floats). The FMA instruction set (`FMA3`) is primarily designed for floating-point operations and does not include integer equivalents.

For integer operations, you must perform the multiply and add operations separately:
1. Use `_mm256_mullo_epi32` for 32-bit integer multiplication (low 32 bits of the result).
2. Use `_mm256_add_epi32` for 32-bit integer addition.

### Example of Separate Multiply and Add
```cpp
__m256i a = _mm256_set1_epi32(2); // Broadcast 2 across the vector
__m256i b = _mm256_loadu_si256((__m256i*)blockB); // Load B
__m256i c = _mm256_loadu_si256((__m256i*)C); // Load C
