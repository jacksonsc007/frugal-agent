For a forest, which is a collection of trees, the total number of edges is less than the total number of vertices minus one. Given 100 vertices, if all were connected in a single tree, we would expect 99 edges (\\(100 - 1 = 99\\)). Since we have 90 edges, the forest is not a single tree. The difference between the expected number of edges for a single tree (99) and the actual number of edges (90) gives us the number of edges missing to connect all trees into one tree, which is \\(99 - 90 = 9\\). However, this step is about understanding the structure, so let's calculate the number of trees. Each tree in the forest contributes \\(V - 1\\) edges. Let \\(n\\) be the number of trees, then \\(90 = 100 - n\\), because each tree has \\(V - 1\\) edges, and \\(n\\) trees would have \\(n\\) fewer edges than \\(100 - 1\\), due to each tree being a separate entity.\n",

This controlled acceleration can lead to a smoother recoil, potentially making it easier to maintain aim. Additionally, the Gauss rifle's recoil might be more predictable and less dependent on the specifics of the ammunition, as the acceleration is determined by the electromagnets rather than chemical combustion.\n",
